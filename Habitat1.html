<blockquote cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/nature/habitats/article/grassland">
    Grassland habitats are places that receive more rain than deserts but less precipitation than forests. Most of the plants here are grasses, which don’t need as much water as forest vegetation.<br> <br>
    Every continent except Antarctica has grasslands, but they have different names in different places: In Africa, they’re called savannas and veldts; pampas in South America; steppes in in Europe and Asia; prairies or grasslands in North America; and rangelands in Australia. One-fourth of the planet is covered by grasslands.<br> <br>
    Grasslands are usually found in the dry interior of continents, between the mountains and deserts. Many grasslands were formed tens of thousands of years ago after the last ice age, when the Earth began to warm up and the climate became drier.<br> <br>

<h2>Cheetahs</h2>

<blockqoute cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/cheetah"> Fastest mammal on land, the cheetah can reach speeds of 60 or perhaps even 70 miles (97 or 113 kilometers) an hour over short distances. It usually chases its prey at only about half that speed, however. After a chase, a cheetah needs half an hour to catch its breath before it can eat.<br> <br>
    Cheetahs eat small- to medium-size animals, such as hares, impalas, wildebeest calves,and gazelles.<br> <br>
    Because of their size, strength, and predatory skills, cheetahs are considered one of the “big cats.” Tigers, lions, leopards, jaguars, and cougars are also part of this grouping.<br> <br>

    <h2>American Bison</h2>

    <blockqoute cite="https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/facts/american-bison">
        Bison are the iconic image of the Great Plains and the Old West. They are massive, shaggy beasts and the heaviest land animals in North America.<br> <br>
        Despite their hefty size, bison are quick on their feet. When the need arises they can run at speeds up to 40 miles (65 kilometers) an hour. Their curved, sharp horns can grow to be 2 feet (61 centimeters) long.<br> <br>
        Females (cows) and adult males (bulls) generally live in small, separate bands and come together in very large herds during the summer breeding season. Males wage battles for mating rights, but such contests rarely turn dangerous. Females give birth to one calf after a nine-month pregnancy.<br> <br>
